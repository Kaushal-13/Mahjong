This folder will be implementing the game states etc.

Tile Representation : 
B -> Bamboo
C -> characters
D -> Dots
W -> Winds  
        -> NEWS for directions

Dr -> Dragon
    -> Color (R,G,W)

So basically red Dragon is DrR.
And East Wind is WE.
And 9 of Bamboos is B9

Basically to deal with moves we can make an engine of sorts that does the following : 

Just some maths let f be the update function then f takes two variables the game state and the move
-> The move is a dynamic tuple for now until we can fixate as to what we can do with it next.
move -> (move_type -> discard stuff like card id etc.)

Core Functionality of the game.
Game goes in 3 steps : 
    # FOr now not implementing the wait part .
    Draw -> Discard -> Wait -> Draw
